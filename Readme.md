## Information

You can control whether or not to scrobble tracks and whether or not to update now playing information. These settings are available in the menu.

As per Last.fm scrobbling guidelines, a track is scrobbled once you've listened to half of its duration or four minutes. A track under 30 seconds in length will not be scrobbled.

Try to keep the artist and track metadata on Plug.dj as accurate as possible. This avoids filling your account with junk, and some incorrect metadata may be rejected by Last.fm.

If you ever have issues, make sure you only have one Plug.dj tab open and reload the page. If that doesn't work, use the menu to relink your account.
