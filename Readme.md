Scrobbles the tracks you listen to on Plug.dj to your Last.fm account.

## Setup

Before Plug.dj Scrobbler can do anything, you need to link your account. Click the Plug.dj Scrobbler button and follow the instructions. Make sure you click the button again and confirm the link after finishing the process on Last.fm.

## Settings

You can access the settings menu by clicking the button once your account is linked. `Scrobble tracks` controls whether or not to scrobble tracks from Plug.dj to Last.fm and `Update now playing` controls whether or not to send now playing information from Plug.dj to Last.fm.

Tracks are scrobbled once you've listened to half of their duration or four minutes. Tracks under 30 seconds long are not scrobbled. These rules are regulated by Last.fm and cannot be changed.
